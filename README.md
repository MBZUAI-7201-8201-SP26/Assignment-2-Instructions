## Part 0: Common Problems

1. Make sure you properly terminate your process so that the card can be freed for others.
2. If you believe the card needs a reset due to buggy programs, you can run `tt-smi --reset`. This will reset all the cards on the machine, so use with responsibility.
3. Rememember you need to have the python environment active if you would like to use `tt-smi` commands, or the python packages of `tt-metal`.
